// inheritance in cpp -> 


/*
1-> it is the part of oops
2-> we can achieve reusability by inheritance 

eg-> if a class name is (employe ) . it has some attribute and there is another class named ( programmer ) // programmer is also employee 
  -> if we use all the properties of calss (employee ) in (programmer) then it is called inhertiance 

HERE  employee -> base class 
      programmer -> derived class

inheritance means = old class + some other features 

3-> reusing a class save times and money // as we write long code then it is defficult to handle that 

what -> the concept of reusabilty is done by inheritance , in this the properity of one class is inherited by another class 
       there can be many base class for a single derived calss 

there are 5 type of inheritance 
1. single inheritance         -> one base class and one derived class from that base class 
2. mutiple inheritance        -> there many base class by which single class is derived  ( 1 baccha 2 papa)
3. hieraarchial inheritance   -> from a single base class there are severla derived class are made ( 1 papa , 2 bacche )
4. multi level inheritance    -> here base class is also derived from another class , and from this base class be made a new derived calss ( grandfather -> father -> child)
5. hybrid inheritnace         -> combination of mutiple and multilevel inheritance
