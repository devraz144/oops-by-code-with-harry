// polymorphism -> one name and multiple form 

// ploymorphism are of two type 
/*
1. run-time polymorphism ( late bandind) -> virtual funtion 
   at the  running timt of  the programe it  decided which function is to be called 
   
2. compile-time polymorphism ( early banding) -> function overloading & operator overloading 
   at the compile -time . compiler get know which function is to be called 


-> Compile Time -> is the preparation and error-checking phase.
-> Run Time -> is when the program is running and doing its job.
