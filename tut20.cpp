// intro to oops -> it is approche

/*
why oops?

c++->c + oop 
c with classes 

programe size increase then readability , maintabilty , and bug free natrue 
of program decrease 

c used to realied upon fumction or procedures ( procdural oriented  programming language (pop))

data security was also a concern bcoz function can be easily accesible 

using classes solve the problem by modeling program as a real world scenario

/*

Procedure Oriented Programming

->Consists of writing a set of instruction for the computer to follow
->The main focus is on functions and not on the flow of data
->Functions can either use local or global data
->Data moves openly from function to function

*/

/*

#oops 

-> Works on the concept of classes and object
-> A class is a template to create objects
-> Treats data as a critical element
-> Decomposes the problem in objects and builds data and functions around the objects

*/

/*
#termonlogy 

Classes - Basic template for creating objects
Objects – Basic run-time entities
Data Abstraction & Encapsulation – Wrapping data and functions into a single unit
Inheritance – Properties of one class can be inherited into others
Polymorphism – Ability to take more than one forms
Dynamic Binding – Code which will execute is not known until the program runs
Message Passing – message (Information) call format
