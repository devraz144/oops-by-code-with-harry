// Variable Scope & Data Type

/*
Variable: A container to hold data.

Types of Variables:
1. Integer
2. Float -> Decimal number of low precision
3. Char
4. Double -> Decimal number of high precision
5. Boolean

Example:
int sum = 34; // sum is a variable that holds the value 34 as an integer in memory
int a = 2, b = 4;
char letter = 'a';

Variable Scope: The region of code where the variable can be accessed.
1. Local Variable: Declared inside the braces/function and can only be accessed there.
2. Global Variable: Declared outside the braces and can be accessible from anywhere in the program.
Note: Local variables have higher precedence than global variables.

Important: Can global and local variables have the same name? Yes.

Data Type: Defines the type of data a variable can hold. For example:
- An integer variable can hold integer data.
- A character variable can hold character data.

Three Types:
1. Built-in (int, float, char, double, boolean)
2. User-defined (struct, union, enum)
3. Derived (array, function, pointer)

Rules to Declare Variable in C++:
- Variable names can range from 1 to 255 characters.
- Must start with a letter or underscore.
- Variable names are case-sensitive.
- No spaces or special characters are allowed.
- Cannot use C++ keywords as variable names.
